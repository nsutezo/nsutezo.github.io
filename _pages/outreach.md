I am passionate about outreach and mentorship, as I have greatly benefited from amazing mentors who have shaped my journey as a researcher. Below are a selection of ongoing outreach collaborative efforts which I deeply enjoy. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to be part of any of these efforts.

* **Fundamentals of AI Workshop (FAI), Ile-Ife, Nigeria**. See workshop description [here](https://iretiayo.github.io/FAI_2020/) and select pictures [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nncm4VWhvqcuE1mLZBkISZZpHH9IZIev).
FAI workshops introduce senior secondary and high schools students to computer skill and fundamentals of AI, with the goal of exposing them early to
the much needed AI methodologies & technologies needed to power developing economies.

* **Game Changers Pitch Competition, Bamenda Cameroon**, in Collaboration with [Jumpstart Africa Academy](https://jumpstartacademyafrica.org/our-programs/). 
Through Game changer Challenges, we provide a fun yet competitive platform for young Cameroonians (in senior secondary and high schools) to pitch innovative ideas and receive feedback and tools 
to transform these ideas into marketable services or products.
