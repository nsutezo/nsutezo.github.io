I am a fourth year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering in the Quadracci Sustainable Engineering Lab (QSEL) at Columbia University, New York City. My research efforts are geared towards two areas: Electricity Demand Prediction and Energy System Design. 

I apply deep learning, computer vision and geospatial techniques towards predicting electricity usage in developing countries. This is of interest because energy providers would be able to leverage such models to anticipate energy generation required to meet the demand. Concurrently, I apply network optimization tools to design the placement of energy infrastructure (transformers, low and medium voltage lines), given the anticipated demand and energy demand nodes. Combining both models, I hope my research will contribute to the design and operation of more energy efficient systems, which offer high levels of reliability.
