This talk demonstrated a two-stage electricity planning approach. Building locations and merging algorithms were used to apporximate residential locations, used as demand nodes for network planning. Given residential nodes, electricity access metrics (low voltage wire length, medium voltage wire length, transformer density and the cost of electrification) are estimated for wards in Kenya. These metrics highlight opportunities for varying electricity technologies (solar, minigrid, full-scale grid).
